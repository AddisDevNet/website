                            <p>Our aim is to create the first open source software development using native on hands.</p>

                            <p class="wrap-blockquote">We are a group of IT enthusiasts, developers, entrepreneurs, and technology geeks who would like to fully contribute to the new emerging of technologies in Ethiopia.We have nothing but passion to work on open source software and projects that can be implemented under ground, we also have the elite of geeks who can collaboratively deducate their time working on the projects.</p>
                            <blockquote class="inline-blockquote">
                                <p>The use of people is that we need them to recognize, aid, help and support startups just like us...We need them to attend events that can help them understand and get to know the updates of technology, besides, we would like them to contribute as third parties' testers to our products and give us their feedback on how to imporove, alter, or remove several features in an app, software, website and so on.</p>

                            <p class="wrap-blockquote">We need students to get their hands on raw materials and start learning programming to help us and themselves improve when endeavoring potential short run projects..We also would like the students to familiarize themselves with the core importance of Technology in the future and how to manipulate such things. We will also help them by trying to implement several codelab sessions and introduction to coding while also help them escalating and shaping their skills in the desired field.</p>

                            <p>We want the coders to competitively, fiercely engage in our open source projects so they can, as our motto goes, LEARN and grow as individuals, CODE for the sake of their respective community and society, INSPIRE those who want to enter the era of Technology but afraid of doing so, also support those who have brilliant, spectacular ideas ,but no programming experience, putting such ideas down to earth with the help of our amazing team of coders. And finally CONNECT, with their peers, teams, and experts to build for a digital environment suitable for everyone, a developer or not, so as to successfully grow up for future careers..Additionally, we want the coders to be able to collaborate with different, various mindsets, with different approachs, of different ideas and programming languages in order to develop, build, and maintain open source projects. We need from the students to engage and be a part of such communities which has a clear vision of what they really want to address.. We want to help them, and by joining us, we can achieve our goal. We need coders to help those who have great ideas but no real implementation, collaborate with their teams to make successful projects see the light, and as individuals develope certain mindsets and change the fact that, "too many cookers may spoil the plate".</p>
